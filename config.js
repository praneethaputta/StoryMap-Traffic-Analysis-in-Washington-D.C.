Washington is No. 3 in traffic congestion" - The Washington Post, Dana Hedgpeth, August 2022 </p> Millions of people deal with traffic congestion daily. The roadways leading into and out of most major cities can become gridlocked due to an accident, road construction, or simply a high number of cars on the road. Traffic congestion can affect drivers, the environment, health, and the economy. </p> A person living in a large city or any area with many commuters on the road is probably familiar with the effects of traffic congestion. What most people need to realize is the extent of the effects heavy traffic congestion can have. Stopping and starting in traffic consumes more petrol than traveling at a constant speed on the open roadway. This increase in fuel usage costs commuters more money for fuel and contributes to the amount of pollution emitted by vehicles. These pollutants pollute the air and contribute to global warming. In addition, congestion increases travel costs and reduce accessibility by increasing travel times. Congestion exposure has substantial adverse effects, such as increased noise pollution, driver stress, decreased mental satisfaction, the citys economic growth, and increased passenger time pressure. </p> Washington, D.C., tops the list for the highest traffic increase in recent times. Traffic in the city was 12.5% higher in March 2022 than in July. In one month, from February to March 2022 alone, traffic in D.C. jumped 16.2%. - NEW YORK POST, 2022 ',

The federal territory was named after the explorer Christopher Columbus, while the national city was named after George Washington. It is situated on the east bank of the Potomac River, which forms its southwestern and southern borders with the state of Virginia, and it shares a land border with the state of Maryland on all other sides. </p> Even before coming of age, D.C. was nearly destroyed. During the War of 1812 against Great Britain, enemy forces invaded the city. They burned much of it to the ground, including the newly completed White House, the Capitol, and the Library of Congress. After the devastation, the city remained small, especially in terms of permanent residents. Soon it would become smaller in physical size as well. </p> The town only increased in size as a result of the Civil War. Post-war, Washington experienced substantial expansion, eventually absorbing nearby Georgetown and surrounding rural areas beyond original plans. Today, it remains a vibrant and culturally diverse city with international cultures and African American heritage.',

While the more recognized Potomac defines its organic southwestern edge with Virginia, the Anacostia cuts through the city, dividing its southeastern quadrant from the rest, which can be accessed only through a few bridges. The west side of the Anacostia River is defined by a classical grid plan, crisscrossed with diagonal avenues whose intersections mark the locations of civic buildings and public spaces. The east side is less formally organized, with a terrain of hills that fragment its street grid and a bucolic riverfront compared to the industrialized western bank. The west is dominated by D.C.s practical and symbolic role as the nations capital. At the same time, the predominantly African-American east side is home to more native D.C. residents than any other neighborhood. Today, the west is high income while the east has the lowest income levels in the district.',

The main themes that have aggravated urban congestion in recent years are economic growth, rising urbanization, ride-hailing services and e-commerce, underinvestment in infrastructure, and uneven results from various policies and initiatives. </p> Unfortunately, D.C. has half a million commuters and some of the countries most extended commute times, according to NPR. As a result, D.C. drivers experienced an annual delay of 42 hours. Those delays led to excess fuel consumption. The yearly Delay per Auto Commuter is nearly 42 hours, and extra Fuel per Auto Commuter is estimated to be 16 gallons. </p> Nevertheless, as much as public transit interconnects people and places, the personal experience of relying on an overburdened transportation system can be painful. For example, in Washington, D.C., rising home values are pushing people to the ends of train and bus lines in pursuit of affordable housing. More than ever, these commuters rely on public transit. However, local transit operators need help keeping their systems safe and reliable. </p> The cities employment opportunities will double by the end of the next decade, and it is high time for responsible government bodies and the general public to act accordingly to make the city a safe, environmentally friendly, and sustainable place.',
